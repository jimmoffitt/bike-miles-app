## The How

The first step was learning more about React specifically and revisitng JavaScript in general. A early step was building a Windows development environment after a decade on MacOS.  In general:

* Set up Windows development environment.
* Clone an example app and refactor it to the "bike ride" domain.
* Deploy and host the app on a cloud server. In this case, the app is hosted on Netlify.

### Setting up development environment

- Setting up IDE

  - Started with PyCharm since I came from a Python background. I went with the Community version. Coming from IntelliJ, this felt comfortable. It was great to start fresh with a new IDE install, and I appreciated all the features, how easy it was to install and manage packages, and the integration of virtual machines. Working with virtual machines led me to the always scary adventure of updating my Windows BIOS. Nothing like that to trigger memories of configuring Windows NT back in the day. 
  - After a few dabbles with Python projects, I decided it was time to jump into webapp UIs in a language that was not Python. I actually started in this JavaScript direction in PyCharm, and it became obvious that a more JavasScript-friendly IDE was in order.
  - Switching to VS Code. Diggin into React led me quickly to VS Code, an IDE that I had played with on and off for a while now. After I found a weather app I wanted to play with, I quickly became quickly impressed with this IDE. I was quickly installing all kinds of packages, running a development server, debugging code in the browser, and feeling at home with a ton of development tasks at hand.

- Setting up a GitHub Windows client.

  - While at Twitter, I maintained a "Git survival guide' that compiled over ten years of git notes compiled since starting at Gnip and was brand new to git (and GitHub). For me, git on the command-line was often a white-knuckled affair. So, now back on Windows, I decided to try out a current Windows client. So far it has been a great way to create and manage repositories.

## Hosting app on a cloud server

- Exploring options for hosting web apps.
  - Trying Netlify.
