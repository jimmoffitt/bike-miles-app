Some TODOs:

* Persist rides data between sessions. 
  * Explore Redux. 

* More advanced UI
  * Current design depends on not having many rides.
  * Need to limit display to some number of rides.
  * Start with limit of 10, and filter by distance or date.

* Pull data from Strava.
  * Once the data store is ready, have an option to load rides since a certain date.
