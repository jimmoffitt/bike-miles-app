# Why?

## tl;dr

This app was build to learn React. And I like biking...

----------------------------------
## It's time to learn how to build webapp UIs

This app was started to learn React. Building webapp user interfaces seemed like a fundamental topic missing from my software development experience. Over a decade ago, I focused on the development of flood-warning software, including a Windows app that had an extensive user interface. This interface enabled flood monitoring system operators to view real-time data on maps, define alarm thresholds, and define channel for notifications. 

But that was a long time ago now, and it's time to port that design experience over to the web using JavaScript. After focusing on Python, Ruby, and Java, this switch to JavaScript has been the main leap. (Working with a non-typed language has its challenges, and I sense another switch to TypeScript.)

The longer version of the 'why' is that this fresh round of coding was trigger by me leaving Twitter to start a new career chapter. Having some time between positions has been a luxury w.r.t. coding on nearly a daily basis. That was not something I pulled off when I has deep into Partner Engineering at Twitter. Our small team was focused enough on providing developer support to a large set of partners that drove nearly $400M/year in revenue. 

Finally, this project was predicated on migration from MacOS/Linux to Windows 11 as a development home. Before 2012, I lived in a mostly Windows world, building apps, storing data, visualizing data, and crunching numbers. Since leaving Twitter and losing access to my MacBook Pro, I was back to my personal Windows machine. A super nice box with lots of RAM and HD, and powerful enough to drive two 28" monitors. Having a touchscreen, lots of ports, and being a tablet convertible is a fun new flavor of development laptop to have. 

Setting up development environments can be time-consuming and challenging, so I was kinda dreading the time sink this foundation would require. A few weeks in, I'm happy to report that building a development environment on a modern Windows system is a smooth ride (so far).
